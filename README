catalyst build environment that creates two different flavor of linux livecds:

 - one that can act as a PXE server when more servers need to be installed in the same subnet
 - a stripped-down version for one-off server installs

dependencies:
 a PATCHED version of catalyst [1], a lot of patience and a few buckets worth of cpu cycles.
